# GO With Your Mood

GO With Your Mood is a facial expression recognition-based movie and music suggestion website that cheer up users and saves time while searching for a movie or song that matches their mood.
## Motivation
In today's world where everyone is striving for achievement, but many people are succumbing to depression as a result of this struggle. Making a few poor decisions occasionally. As a result, *GO With Your Mood* was designed to assist people in de-stressing by recommending movies and songs based on their feelings.

## Features
1. It recognizes facial expression based on the 7 categories i.e., angry, sad, fear, happy, disgust, surprise and neutral.
2. Based on the emotion it gives user two choices  either suggesting movies or songs.
3. If user wishes to watch movies/songs then a list of movies/songs matching their mood are suggested with movie/songs poster.
4. When user clicks on movie which he wishes to watch, they will be redirected to IMDB website and for songs it redirects them to Spotify website.

## Tech Stack
1. Python is the programming language used to create the emotion recognition model
2. deploy it on the web application using flask. 
3. CV2, TensorFlow, NumPy, matplotlib, and other libraries are also utilized. 
4. This model is deployed on a website created with HTML and CSS using the flask framework.

## Challenges 
On the web, it was difficult to discover Movies and Songs datasets that showed various emotions. Finding templates for emotional films and songs proved to be a difficult task. Getting the website to access 7 movie templates from the movies button and 7 song templates from the songs button based on the emotion sensed was a difficult undertaking. The templates for movies/songs corresponding to the model's output were accessed through dynamic links.

## Accomplishments 
Developing a project that is relevant to today's generation. Despite being separated by a great distance, they worked in synchrony. Putting together this fantastic product in such a short amount of time! I learned a lot about Python and various frameworks, such as flask and its integration, as well as a lot of new Python libraries. We conceived and built the full solution in such a short period of time, overcoming all hurdles and finding a workaround for each issue.

## What I Learned
I learned about the model's transfer learning technique, which helped us identify faces, as well as how to create basic web pages using HTML and CSS, as well as how to publish the model on the web using flask.
